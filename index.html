          <h1>What is an MRI?</h1>
          <p>MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a painless, non-invasive exam that can produce images of the
              entire body without harmful radiation like x-rays. It is used to facilitate precise diagnosis and
              treatment as well as assessments prior to surgery or other medical procedures.</p>

          <p>It is the most advanced form of medical imaging technology available. Several Nobel Peace Prizes have
              been awarded for advancements discovered during the development of MRI technology!</p>
